comparability dimenstionality reduction on stream data (use existing algo for example PCA & clustering(if needed) )
proof of concept : use own method for example em reordering
travelling sales algo
em reordering ( new thing to implement on the straming data)
entropy minimization
information loss/ gain
measure calculate : entropy minimization, information loss/ gain

technology : java, 
look for pros/ cons based on application specific
cpu utility, hardware resource
benchmarking : 

PCA goes for motivation step
dataset : from a particular field

*goal
*why not existing algo works
*approach

date 08.09
* yarke mail by arnab
* column reordering is useful for in terms of visualisation
* establish a relationship between dimensionality reduction and column reordering
* drawback of dimensionality reduction is information loss
* goal : 	1. why its not ideal approach
		 	2. what is is proposed solution and implementation
		 	3. evaluation of the solution for example streaming dataset.
