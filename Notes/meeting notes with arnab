comparability dimenstionality reduction on stream data (use existing algo for example PCA & clustering(if needed) )
proof of concept : use own method for example em reordering
travelling sales algo
em reordering ( new thing to implement on the straming data)
entropy minimization
information loss/ gain
measure calculate : entropy minimization, information loss/ gain

technology : java, 
look for pros/ cons based on application specific
cpu utility, hardware resource
benchmarking : 

PCA goes for motivation step
dataset : from a particular field
