what i did on 7th aug :
1. khan academy - unit vectors + parametric representations of lines + introduction to linear independence + more on linear independence
				  + span and linear independence example
 from linear algebra
2. youtube -LDA understands
3. patrick jmt : span of vectors
4. Supervised Dimensionality Reduction on Streaming Data (paper) : page 1

notes : the span is all of the vectors that can be represented by linear combibations of the given vectors  

what i did on 8th aug :
1. covariation matrix from Brandon Foltz
2. corelation matrix from Brandon Foltz
3. entropy & information gain definition from mfschulte222
4. Efficient Visualization of Large-scale Data Tables through Reordering and Entropy Minimization:
		section 1
	Used available machine learning technology : spectral clustering, locally linear embedding, stochastic neighbourhood embedding
