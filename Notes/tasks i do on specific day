what i did on 7th aug :
1. khan academy - unit vectors + parametric representations of lines + introduction to linear independence + more on linear independence
				  + span and linear independence example
 from linear algebra
2. youtube -LDA understands
3. patrick jmt : span of vectors
4. Supervised Dimensionality Reduction on Streaming Data (paper) : page 1

notes : the span is all of the vectors that can be represented by linear combibations of the given vectors
