preparation for 11.08

1. amazon kinesis
2 reordering is a visualization tool?
3. used algo from Supervised Dimensionality Reduction on Streaming Data : 
	* LDA
	* single pass algo for example incremental LDA algo, 
	* incremental IDR/ QR

4. paper notes on Efficient Visualization of Large-scale Data Tables through Reordering and Entropy Minimization.
5. dimensionality reduction are only helpful for visualisation?
	answer by myself : nope, it also used for the compresssion data and also for speeding up the learning algo
6. feature extraction/ feature selection :
	feature extraction : Linear / Non linear -->
							* Linear : Principle Component Analysis, Linear Discrement Analysis, Maximum Margerion Criterion
							* Non-linear : Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), ISOMAP [30], Laplacian Eigenmaps 

come to know about new tools : 1. talend 2. apache kafka
from wikipedia most popular/used dimensionality reduction are : 
1. PCA
2. Kernel PCA
3. Graph-based kernel PCA
4. Linear discriminant analysis
5. generalised discriminant analysis

non-linear dimensionality reduction technique :
1. Locally linear embedding
2. stochastic neighbourhood embedding

preparation for 23.08
both 1 and 2 are approach to select feature
1. new algo for the feature selection (paper: Feature-Based Data Stream Clustering)
2. to do : A Framework for Projected Clustering of High Dimensional Data Streams
3. to do : Features selection for clustering - A filter solution
4. Supervised Dimensionality Reduction on Streaming Data : mathematical part
5. autoencoder
6. https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=related:Q9nc0GKB3pIJ:scholar.google.com/&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&sciodt=0,5

preparation for 24.08
1. IS EM ordering also a supervised?
